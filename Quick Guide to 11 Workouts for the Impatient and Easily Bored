Kickboxing: Punch and kick a bag or dude. Quick moves, lotsa sweat. Learn to block too.

Kettlebell Training: Lift weird-shaped weights. Swing 'em, get strong hands and fast heart.

Animal Flow Workout: Act like animals. Crawl like a bear. No gym stuff, just you.

AGT Workout: Work on tummy, butt, and legs. Planks and squats, man. Get those areas tight.

Bhangra: Jump and clap to beats. Super fun, like a party. Indian dance, bro.

Strength and Conditioning: Lift heavy, then run or jump. Get strong and fast. Not chill.

Functional Training: Do moves you'd do in real life. Pick up stuff, pull yourself. No show-off.

Crossfit: Crazy mix. Lift, jump, run. Super fast, no breaks. Like gym on fire.

Yoga: Stretch and hold. Real slow, deep breaths. Calm but tough.

Zumba: Dance workout. Follow the leader, shake it. Latin beats, so yeah.

Bollywood Dance: Dance like movie stars. Lots of hand moves, spin and smile. Feel the drama.
